## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **Node.js** & **Express.js** â€“ Backend runtime and routing
- **MongoDB** + **Mongoose** â€“ NoSQL database and schema modeling
- **TypeScript** â€“ Type safety for better development experience
- **Cloudinary** â€“ Image upload and cloud storage
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** â€“ User authentication and authorization
- **Day.js** â€“ Lightweight date utility for time-based logic
